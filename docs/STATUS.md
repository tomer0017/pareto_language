# STATUS — READY build report

Date: 2026-07-04 · All four milestones (M0–M4) complete and committed. Full verification
loop (typecheck → lint → tests → build → smoke) green at every milestone.

## What's done

### M0 — Foundation & Engine
- npm-workspaces monorepo, TS strict (project references), ESLint 9 + Prettier, Vitest.
- `packages/content-schema`: zod schemas for every content + user-state entity (PDF §12).
- `packages/engine` (pure, zero I/O): FSRS-inspired memory model `R(t)=exp(−t/S)` with
  per-mode evidence weighting (swipe = weak prior); deadline-aware greedy scheduler
  (`value × R-gain / seconds-cost` toward R at departure, long-horizon after the trip);
  plan engine (weighted tier selection ≤85% capacity, situation ordering, new-item taper,
  graceful re-plan); readiness rules (notStarted/inProgress/ready/fading, spaced verification,
  emergency L3 gate). Coverage ~98% statements / 91% branches (bar: 85%).
- **Simulated-learner proof**: virtual learners with configurable forgetting rates run a real
  7-day × 30-min plan; ≥80% of Tier-1 phrases reach L2+ at departure; the scheduler never
  exceeds the daily budget; holds across a 5-seed cohort.

### M1 — Content
- `content/it-IT/pack.yaml`: 182 Tier-0/1 items — 10 situations (core phrases, 4–6 likely
  replies each, recognition words, one branching dialogue, ≤3 culture tips), 14 politeness-glue
  phrases (fluent target), 26-number curriculum incl. prices/time stages. `it-IT v0.1.0`,
  `needsNativeReview: true`.
- Pipeline: YAML → zod validation → referential/tier/dialogue integrity → versioned JSON pack +
  manifest into `apps/web/public/content/`. `validate:content` is the CI gate (8 content tests).
- TTS integration point: asset-path convention + `AudioResolver`/`TtsProvider` interfaces; Web
  Speech API fallback in the app; real recordings swap in per-item with no client change.

### M2 — App (MVP)
- `packages/data`: `DataProvider` interface; `MockProvider`; `LocalProvider` = permanent
  IndexedDB offline layer (append-only event log, sync queue, pack cache, projection via the
  shared engine); `ApiProvider` (M3).
- React 18 PWA (feature-sliced, Zustand): onboarding (§10.1), Home/Mission Control, Session
  Player with one interaction shell and modes 1–6 (Swipe Triage, Flash Recall with latency
  fluency evidence, Echo, Understand-the-Answer with logged slow-replay, Number Sprint with
  personal best, Situation Simulator with branching dialogues), Warm-up→Learn→Integrate→Close
  with capability summary, 3-strike relearn loop, instant per-drill persistence
  (interruptible), Readiness Board (incl. Fading + projected recall), Phrasebook, Emergency
  Card (huge type, show-to-a-local, 112), Plan & Settings with honest re-planning.
- PWA: manifest + service worker; app shell and content pack precached; fully offline after
  first load. Calm two-accent design, thumb-zone actions, no gamification anywhere.

### M3 — Backend, Sync & Google Auth
- Express `/api/v1` (PDF §13): content manifest, anonymous users (adopt client id), plan CRUD,
  idempotent `POST /me/review-events:batch`, memory-state restore, session logs, readiness.
  zod validation everywhere, typed `AppError` middleware, async-safe handlers.
- MongoDB (Mongoose) per §12.3 with indexes; `reviewEvents` append-only; `memoryStates`
  re-projected by the same engine code the client runs.
- Google Sign-In: GIS button (client) → ID-token verification (`google-auth-library`) → JWT
  httpOnly cookie → anonymous→Google identity merge (events moved, state re-projected, plan
  kept). `.env.example` + RUNBOOK document the console steps.
- 10 Supertest API tests against mongodb-memory-server.

### M4 — Hardening & verification
- Error handling: AppError middleware, per-feature ErrorBoundaries, audio fallbacks that never
  dead-end a drill, sync retry with exponential backoff + online-event trigger, user-facing
  retry states in onboarding/init/plan.
- `npm run smoke`: scripted plan → session → events persisted → readiness updates → offline
  reload over the real built pack — 15/15 checks pass.
- Fixed during hardening: planner tier selection now uses weighted item costs (recognition =
  0.35× production per §6.3), so the flagship 7-day × 30-min user correctly gets Tier 1; tier
  selection also caps at the pack's deepest authored tier. Regression-tested.
- Final: 74 tests green, typecheck/lint clean, production builds of web + server.

## Known gaps (honest list)

1. **Content needs native review** — `needsNativeReview: true`; a native Italian speaker must
   sign off per R1. Culture tips are written in Italian; consider English for MVP users.
2. **Audio is Web Speech API TTS** until real recordings (or neural TTS files) are dropped into
   `apps/web/public/audio/it/` — the swap path is built and tested.
3. **Echo mode has no mic record-and-compare** (D017) — v1.1 addition.
4. **Google Sign-In needs your Google Cloud client id** (RUNBOOK steps); until then the app
   runs anonymous + fully offline.
5. **Dev-tooling npm audit findings** (vitest/vite dev-server advisories) require major-version
   bumps of the test/build toolchain; they do not affect production artifacts. Tracked, not
   fixed, to avoid destabilizing the verified toolchain (D026).
6. **In-Trip Mode, Sign Scan, Panic Mode, more languages** — per PDF roadmap (v1.1+), not MVP.

## Verification snapshot

```
typecheck  ✓ tsc -b (schema, engine, data, server) + content + web
lint       ✓ eslint (0 problems)
tests      ✓ 74 passed / 74 (engine 41 · content 10 · data 13 · api 10)
coverage   ✓ engine ~98% stmts / 91% branches (bar 85%)
build      ✓ packages + content pack + PWA (precache 13 entries) + server dist
smoke      ✓ 15/15 checks (plan → session → persistence → readiness → offline reload)
```
